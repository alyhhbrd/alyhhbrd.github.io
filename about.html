<body class="about">

  <h5><q>She does a lot of daydreaming; imagining herself as the extrovert that she is not.</q></h5>

  <p>In reality, I'm computer support for a community college IT department. To people I'm trying to impress, I am a
    front-end website developer.</p>

  <h1>My friends call me Lee.</h1>
  <img src="me.jpg" alt="me" height="260" width="150">

  <p>Born in Chicago, exiled to North Carolina in 2015. Since then I've received an AAS in Computer Programing &
    Development while dabbling in photography, design, calligraphy and other dweeb things. I also enjoy chubby animals
    and using awkward humor at inappropriate times to trick people into thinking I'm cool.
